    "*What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*\n",
    "üìù How do crime incidents in Cincinnati vary over time and across different neighborhoods? The problem I am trying to address is the impact of police response times and on crime rates in Cincinnati. One reason why many parents may worry about putting their kids for University of Cincinnati as the surrounding areas are high in crime rates and can be very dangerous. By evaluating these datasets and API, it can help local law enforcement and community stakeholders analyze the effectiveness of police operations and how resources are being allocated. With the Cincinnati Police Data Initiative dataset, we can identify trends that reveal how different types of crimes have a relationship with varied response times on different neighborhoods and time periods. For example, if longer response times are consistently involved with increased crime rates, this can highlight the areas that need additional officers or resources etc. to improve community safety. This project is meant to uncover patterns that can guide our law enforcement to make more efficient policing strategies and contribute to the overall safety and well-being of Cincinnati's residents, including UC students!!!\n"

    "üìù With this project, I am seeking to answer the specific question: How do police response times correlate with different types of crime rates in Cincinnati. What suggestions does this relationship have for resource allocation and community safety? \n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring this question, I want to find out if longer response times lead to higher crime rates, identify which neighborhoods/areas are most affected, and assess the effectiveness of our current policing strategies. Also I want to understand if certain types of crimes have faster response rates or vice verse, and thus this could educate targeted civilians and cause some policy adjustments. Overall this analysis will help guide decisions on how to optimize police resources and enhance public safety and build more community trust in our law enforcement."

    "## What would an answer look like?\n",
    "*What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*\n",
    "üìù My hypothesized answer is that longer police response times are related with higher crime rates in Cincinnati. I expect to discover that areas with longer response times experience a greater number of violent crimes, like assault and robbery, compared to property crimes. And these may be less influenced by immediate and more quick police presence. Also, I believe that certain neighborhoods, particularly those with fewer police resources, will show more inequalities in crime rates related to response times. This analysis may expose that quick responses are imperative in preventing crimes and/or addressing ongoing incidents effectively. In conclusion, the findings could indicate a need for reallocating police resources to enhance response procedures in areas with high-crime."

    "üìù My approach to answering my project question is a systematic one. I will being by starting with data preparation and analysis. That means I will clean both the Police Calls for Service and Crime Incidents datasets, to make sure fields like timestamps and location data etc are all consistent. Then move onto handling any missing or irrelevant data so it will mess up later on in the project. Next, I will merge the two datasets by matching incidents based on time and location. This will allow me to link calls for service with the corresponding crime events. When I am calculating response times for each call it will help determine the time difference between when the call was made and when the officers actually arrived on the scene. Moving on, we will analyze how response times vary for the different types of crime like violent and property crimes. Then we can use those findings to investigate patterns in how severe they were. It can also help us assess whether delays in certain areas are contributing to crime patterns or affecting police effectiveness. Then finally I will use statistical methods to explore the relationship between response times and crime outcomes more closer, like through regression modeling for instance."

    "The police incidents dataset gives us many summaries, espeically the hour_from column because it has a mean of 741 and shows significant variability meaning there is a wide range of incident times. As for the correlation analysis it is limited since there is only one numeric feature, but we can use teh categorical relationships like \"offense\" against hour_from to get some trends too. There is a high percentage of missing values that I want to point out; for example: victim_ethnicity and totalnumbervictims which does affect the overall analysis. Additionally there are many data types that require conversion. Some columns like longitude_x and latitude_x should be numeric but they are not, and the dates for \"date_reported\" should be in datetime format to be easier to work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shootings dataset has 1,490 entries, and it provides important summaries for columns like LATITUDE_X, LONGITUDE_X, and Age, with the averages for each roughly being 39.14 (lat), -84.52 (long), and 29.59 (age). When I look at the data distributions, it seems that age has a normal distribution but lattitude and longitude have some outliers. This leads me to think it would be interesting to analyze how age relates to other demographic factors like race and this data set. But this might be difficult to do since they are categorical variables. To note a few data issues, there are some missing values in columns like lattitude and sna neighborhood, but I did not find any duplicates which is good for keeping the data clean. Then for data types, I believe that the DateTimeOccurred column should be converted to a datetime format to make it easier to analyze dates and times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Use of Force dataset contains 21,818 entries and like the rest also posesseses various columns, including \"INCIDENT_NO\" and \"INCIDENT_DATE.\" The stats show a mean latitude of about 39.13 and a mean longitude of approximately -84.52 so this give us the exact points and location context of the incidents we work with in the data set. A downside I saw right away were that there are a lot of missing values, especially in lattitude and longitude.There is over 9000 entries missing for thos two columns and this could definitely affect spatial analysis. Other missing values in the categorical columns are for instance SUBJECT_GENDER and OFFICER_GENDER. But the good thing is there are no duplicate records. I noted that for data types I had to change, the INCIDENT_DATE column needs to be converted from object to datetime for better analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Calls dataset has the most data records is what I noticed, specifically with a massive 5,626,155 entries. Some key columns being CREATE_TIME_INCIDENT and DISPOSITION_TEXT. The data has a variety of types like datetime for incident creation time and float for priority levels which I thought was unique from the others greatly. Though, the missing values in this set are significant since it is so big, like in columns PRIORITY_COLOR and SNA_NEIGHBORHOOD, where over 2 million entries are missing. This could affect my analysis related to response times and neighborhood impacts if I choose to stick with that still. The bright side is that there are no duplicate records to worry about in addition. The latitude and longitude columns show valid float values but there are still a lot of missing data points in these coordinates. To improve the dataset's accuracy, I will strongly consider filling in missing values where possible and making sure all datetime columns are correctly formatted."

The most common incidents appear to be \"injury to prisoner\" and the use of force methods like tasers or beanbags (not sure what that even means honestly), especially in the neighborhoods of Over-the-Rhine (OTR) and Avondale. While I don't have a clear reason for Avondale's rates, I do know very well that OTR has many bars, so that makes sense for alcohol-related incidents to contribute to higher use of force. I chose a clustered bar chart to clearly represent the frequency of these incidents across neighborhoods, making it easy to compare multiple incident types without losing context on neighborhood-specific differences."

    "This graph illustrates the different types of incidents throughout the week. I used a stacked bar chart to visualize which days had the highest counts of incidents and the specific types involved. I noticed that \"WAR\" incidents were the most common across all days, which I looked up online and found that it stands for \"Weapons, Assault, and Robbery.\" Even though this term reprsents several types of incidents, it limits my ability to draw specific conclusions about the individual categories and the count of occurences for each. Following WAR incidents, the next most common types are non-urgent and urgent welfare checks. I find it interesting that the incident type with the fewest occurrence shows a clear count, but the second least common type does not display a specific count on top or inside the chart part making it appear nonexistent among the five incident types in the visualization."

    "WHile cleaning the dataset, I first worked on dealing with the missing values, which were clearly present in various columns like CFS_NO and SUBJECT_GENDER. For columns with only a few missing values, I decided to fill them in with the most common value as I felt that was reasonable how we did with other exploratory data analyses before this assignment. But for others with significant missing gaps, like LATITUDE_X and LONGITUDE_X, I chose to drop those rows to maintain data integrity and make it easier for me to work with the data. Next I moved on to check for duplicate values and found that there were none, which is comforting because it means my data is clean for the most part. When looking for anomalies, I noticed some unusually high values in the PRIORITY column and I wil need to investigate those more to see if they skew or badly effect the analysis. Then I converted the CREATE_TIME_INCIDENT column to a datetime format to make it easier to work with and for better readability on the visualizations section. Overall, my cleaning process involved filling in missing data, checking for outliers, and making sure all data types are appropriate for analysis to assist me in preparing a solid dataset for more advanced exploration to answer the project question."
