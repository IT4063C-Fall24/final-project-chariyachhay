    "## Topic\n",
    "*What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*\n",
    "üìù The problem I am trying to address is the impact of police response times and on crime rates in Cincinnati. One reason why many parents may worry about putting their kids for University of Cincinnati as the surrounding areas are high in crime rates and can be very dangerous. By evaluating these datasets and API, it can help local law enforcement and community stakeholders analyze the effectiveness of police operations and how resources are being allocated. With the Cincinnati Police Data Initiative dataset, we can identify trends that reveal how different types of crimes have a relationship with varied response times on different neighborhoods and time periods. For example, if longer response times are consistently involved with increased crime rates, this can highlight the areas that need additional officers or resources etc. to improve community safety. This project is meant to uncover patterns that can guide our law enforcement to make more efficient policing strategies and contribute to the overall safety and well-being of Cincinnati's residents, including UC students!!!\n"

    "üìù With this project, I am seeking to answer the specific question: How do police response times correlate with different types of crime rates in Cincinnati. What suggestions does this relationship have for resource allocation and community safety? \n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring this question, I want to find out if longer response times lead to higher crime rates, identify which neighborhoods/areas are most affected, and assess the effectiveness of our current policing strategies. Also I want to understand if certain types of crimes have faster response rates or vice verse, and thus this could educate targeted civilians and cause some policy adjustments. Overall this analysis will help guide decisions on how to optimize police resources and enhance public safety and build more community trust in our law enforcement."

    "## What would an answer look like?\n",
    "*What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*\n",
    "üìù My hypothesized answer is that longer police response times are related with higher crime rates in Cincinnati. I expect to discover that areas with longer response times experience a greater number of violent crimes, like assault and robbery, compared to property crimes. And these may be less influenced by immediate and more quick police presence. Also, I believe that certain neighborhoods, particularly those with fewer police resources, will show more inequalities in crime rates related to response times. This analysis may expose that quick responses are imperative in preventing crimes and/or addressing ongoing incidents effectively. In conclusion, the findings could indicate a need for reallocating police resources to enhance response procedures in areas with high-crime."

    "## Approach and Analysis\n",
    "*What is your approach to answering your project question?*\n",
    "*How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*\n",
    "üìù My approach to answering my project question is a systematic one. I will being by starting with data preparation and analysis. That means I will clean both the Police Calls for Service and Crime Incidents datasets, to make sure fields like timestamps and location data etc are all consistent. Then move onto handling any missing or irrelevant data so it will mess up later on in the project. Next, I will merge the two datasets by matching incidents based on time and location. This will allow me to link calls for service with the corresponding crime events. When I am calculating response times for each call it will help determine the time difference between when the call was made and when the officers actually arrived on the scene. Moving on, we will analyze how response times vary for the different types of crime like violent and property crimes. Then we can use those findings to investigate patterns in how severe they were. It can also help us assess whether delays in certain areas are contributing to crime patterns or affecting police effectiveness. Then finally I will use statistical methods to explore the relationship between response times and crime outcomes more closer, like through regression modeling for instance."
